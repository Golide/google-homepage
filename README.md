# My first project.

The objective is to recreate this [Google homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/), obviously trying to use as many of the tools learnt thus far. This is my first try and i'll leave it up as is so I can hopefully look back from the future and see how far i've come. I especially feel like I could have shortened the CSS somehow but well..

Anywyas the project is from [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com).

Keep on hacking.
